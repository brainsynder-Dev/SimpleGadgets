# Developed by: brainsynder
# Version 0.1 developer api (How to make Gadgets) video: http://brainsynder.tk/SimpleGadgets/
# Spigot download link: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simplegadgets.22728/
# Current version: 1.3
#
# Note: I have a reason why you can't change the locations of the gadgets, and it because It will
#   mess-up the page making (What allowes you to have infinate pages for infinate gadgets). I might
#   make it so in the future you can change what gadgets are on certain pages, but that will be a later time.
